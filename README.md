Certainly! When configuring a Spring Boot application with WSO2 Identity Server 5.10.0 for SAML2 using Spring Security 6, your application.properties file should include several key settings. Below is an example configuration, which you will need to tailor based on your specific environment and requirements:

properties
Copy code
# Server port
server.port=8080

# SAML2 configurations
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.entity-id=http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.signing.credentials[0].private-key-location=classpath:saml/private-key.pem
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.signing.credentials[0].certificate-location=classpath:saml/public-certificate.pem
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.decryption.credentials[0].private-key-location=classpath:saml/private-key.pem
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.decryption.credentials[0].certificate-location=classpath:saml/public-certificate.pem
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.idp-metadata-uri=http://<WSO2-IS-Host>:<Port>/metadata/saml2
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.asserting-party-details.entity-id=http://wso2is.local
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.asserting-party-details.single-sign-on-service-location=http://<WSO2-IS-Host>:<Port>/samlsso
saml2.relyingparty.registration.wso2-issuer.asserting-party-details.want-authn-requests-signed=true
Here's a breakdown of the key properties:

Entity ID: This is the unique identifier for your service provider (SP), typically a URL.

Signing Credentials: These are the private key and certificate used to sign SAML requests. They need to be in PEM format and placed in the classpath.

Decryption Credentials: These are used to decrypt any encrypted assertions sent by the IdP.

IDP Metadata URI: The URL where your application can retrieve the metadata from WSO2 IS. This is important for automatically configuring the connection to the IdP.

Asserting Party Details: These settings define the details of your IdP (WSO2 IS), including the entity ID and the URL for the SSO service.

Remember to replace placeholders like <WSO2-IS-Host> and <Port> with the actual host and port of your WSO2 IS instance. Also, ensure that the paths to your private key and certificate are correct.

This configuration assumes that you have already set up your WSO2 IS as an identity provider and have registered your Spring Boot application as a service provider within WSO2 IS. Make sure that the entity IDs and URLs in your Spring Boot configuration match those configured in WSO2 IS.

Lastly, keep in mind that Spring Security 6 might have specific requirements or configurations, so always refer to the official Spring Security documentation for the most up-to-date information.
